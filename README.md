# 6-Projects-in-Java

In this Repo, we're going to solve different problems using Java with various degrees of complexity. Ideally, you are already familiar with the Java programming language, and you have completed a few projects on your own. You will need to be familiar with managing external libraries for Java, doing tasks like importing them and setting the class pass if needed. If you are using any modern Java IDE, these tasks may already be automatically done for you. Regarding tools, we'll be using the Java Development Kit version 8 and Visual Studio Code as our IDE. You will see pom.xml files in some of our projects. This is because we're using Maven as our build tool when necessary. If it's a simple project, we just call the Java compiler directly from the console. The console you'll see us use is call Cmder. The reason why we use it is because it's visually appealing and we can type Linux-style commands in our Windows PC. But you can use the regular Windows Command Prompt as well. When going over each problem, first, I'll give you an overview, and then, propose a solution. You'll see me live coding the critical feature of each problem, and then, we'll run it and check the results.
